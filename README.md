# <h1 align="center"> <b>Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition and Augmented Reality (AR) Interface Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning</b><br></h1>
This project presents a real-time hand gesture recognition system combined with augmented reality (AR) visualizations, user interface (UI) control, and voice command integration. The system leverages computer vision (CV) and machine learning techniques to detect, track, and recognize hand gestures using the MediaPipe framework, implemented in a Python environment with OpenCV for video processing and visualization. This project has potential applications in human-computer interaction (HCI), augmented reality, and assistive technologies.
